# [Project 1: Anticipating Diabetes](https://github.com/ap4godfrey227/PredictingDiabetes.git)
* Compared the effectiveness of different supervised learning techniques: Random Forest vs Logistic Regression
* Implemented effective measures to combat data imbalance after considering multiple methods
* Prioritized the optimization of specific statistical values in order to achieve the more important contextual outcomes
* Efficiently managed over 250,000 observations with 22 variables per observation in a timely manner

# [Project 2: Weather Prediction Methods](https://github.com/ap4godfrey227/Machine-Learning-Project-1.git)
* Developed multiple methods to try and predict the weather of Phoenix, Arizona based on 30 years of daily weather data.
* Implemented a model to predict the temperature using the k nearest neighbors method.
* Trained a supervised model to guess the season of a given weather data point using a naive-bayes classifier.

# [Project 3: Movie Rating Predictions (Capstone)](https://github.com/ap4godfrey227/CapstoneProject.git)
I set out to find some method to predict what users of a movie review website would rate a given film. I intended to have this information to lead an analysis on the trends of user demographics and how much various factors affect a movie review. Due to the nature of the data collected, and the lack thereof in some cases, there was not a solid platform to begin the subsequent analysis. Once I find another set of similar data, I intend to reattempt this project utilizing a neural network instead of multinomial logistic regression as well.
